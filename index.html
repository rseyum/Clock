          A JavaScript project by Rahel Seyum Good Afternoon! This page was
          taken from an HTML5 Flexible template that could be a good starting
          point for some of your projects. The template file starts by setting a
          background color on the HTML element, and setting max-width on the
          body, which is styled like a wrapper. The BODY element is also set to
          a percentage width so it leaves a bit of HTML color until it shrinks
          in size toward the mobile view. There is an image with a class of
          FLEXIBLE which is set to a max-width equal to the size of the image.
          Simutaneously the class sets the image to a percentage width, allowing
          the image to flex in size. The height is not changed, as this would
          skew the image. The LIST elements inside the NAV are displayed inline
          by setting the display to be inline-block. Bullets are removed by
          setting the UL to display The FOOTER includes a clear:both to keep
          everything above it!
